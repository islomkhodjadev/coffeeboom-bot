Cofeeboom (sometimes spelled "Coffee Boom") 
is a prominent coffee shop chain with locations in both Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan, and various cities across Kazakhstan, including Astana and Almaty. 
These cafes are known for their lively, modern vibe and a broad menu that caters to a variety of tastes, 
from traditional coffee and specialty drinks to Western-style fast food and local dishes.

In Tashkent, Coffee Boom is situated inside the "Poytaht" Business Center,
offering a convenient spot for both takeaway and delivery services.
They are recognized for their use of 100% Arabica beans, 
signature Boom Ice Tea, and a selection of frappuccinos,
with a portion of their sales going to charity.

In Kazakhstan, the Coffee Boom outlets are typically found in city centers and shopping malls, 
making them accessible spots for both residents and visitors.
The chain stands out for its early opening hours, which is somewhat unusual in the region,
and offers an extensive menu that includes not only beverages but also breakfast options,
burgers, sandwiches, and vegetarian meals
. The atmosphere in these cafes is generally described as friendly and cozy, 
often bustling with activity.
